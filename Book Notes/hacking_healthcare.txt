Hacking Healthcare

	•	Introduction
	•	About the same number of people die from automobile accidents as medical errors in the US
	•	VA Hospital Success
	•	The Best Care Anywhere by Phillip Longman
	•	level of integration experienced by VA hospitals is super high
	•	near-complete health data liquidity
	•	The improvements to healthcare happen because of computerization will not be a revolution, but an evolution
	•	To understand genotype, we have to understand phenotype…that takes a health system, full of data
	•	meaningful use — represents reasonable first steps toward long term potential health for IT
	•	ACO — accountable care organization
	•	Capitation — means that providers are paid a set monthly fee for covered patients, whether they are sick or not. 
	•	in theory, capitation incentivizes providers to keep patients healthy, thereby reducing the amount of money spent on their healthcare over the long term
	•	In HMO’s, instead of responding to the incentives in capitation by improving the quality of healthcare delivery, they cut corners and abandoned patients to save money
	•	ACO’s focus only on the doctor results
	•	Ensuring that data is liquid is much more complex than just gathering it together
	•	You will be able to see through those pundits who frequently present health IT molehills as mountains, or vise versa.
	•	Highest hopes for Health IT: to make a real difference in people’s lives

	•	Anatomy of Medical Practice
	•	“When you’ve seen one medical practice, you’ve seen one medical practice.”
	•	The largest vendor in EHR systems still only holds 12% of the market
	•	Inpatient — facilities that treat patients primarily in 24-hour cycles or fractions thereof
	•	where the patient is treated continuously in small increments of time, regularly running over 24 hours
	•	Outpatient — facilities that treat patients primarily in distinct visits (few minutes to most of a day)
	•	Care where the interaction with the patient is episodic

	•	How Patients Reach Healthcare
	•	The first thing to understand about medical operations is how patients find their way to medical operations
	•	The way patients find themselves coming in an inpatient facility is usually not a positive one
	•	Outpatient organizations that specialize in same day visits are usually called urgent care facilities, and tend not to see patients on an ongoing basis
	•	The federal government recognizes 240 specialties, but practically speaking, there are thousands
	•	The federal government recognizes 100 inpatient categories, but practically speaking, there are easily 1000

	•	HIPAA and Patient Identification
	•	Patients are obligated to provide comprehensive details about known allergies, existing medications, and both personal and family medical history
	•	As a result of the informed consent process, much administrative overhead is spent documenting, educating, and tracking consents. The informed consents are often handled by the provider, in concert with the billing personnel collecting the information from the patients or their responsible parties
	•	For organizations with multiple locations, it is not uncommon for a single patient to be assigned multiple MRN’s
	•	If multiple records with distinct record numbers exist for the same physical person, they will need to be merged or linked, or else crucial information will be fragmented or missed.

	•	Intake, Demographics, Visits and Admissions
	•	Demographics collection and intake paperwork is almost always followed by in interaction with a nurse, or medical assistant (mid-level providers).
	•	Mid-levels collect information about allergies and current medications, and qualify the reason for the visit or admission. Depending on the circumstances, personal as well as family medical history might be taken, although the specifics vary based on the line of care or procedure scheduled.

	•	Pre-Certification and Prior Authorization
	•	Pre-certification can provide a level of certainty to the treating organization that the procedure will be paid for by the patient’s insurance company before it is actually performed. 
	•	Pre-certification results in a special authorization code that must appear in the billing documents for the patient
	•	At inpatient facilities, this is typically called ‘prior authorization’

	•	Emergency Admissions
	•	Patients facing imminent risk of severe injury or death, known as morbidity and mortality, can be considered as trauma patients
	•	Patients who are facing serious or potentially life-threatening condition but who might have some amount of time for their care to be coordinated are known as acute cases

	•	Outpatient Care
	•	Meaningful use with limited exceptions requires their collection on every new encounter with the patient
	•	people who interact with patients regarding clinical issues can be collectively referred to as providers
	•	Family Nurse Practitioner (FPN)
	•	Physician Assistant (PA)
	•	Osteopathic Medicine (DO)
	•	Medical Doctor (MD)
	•	General Practice interactions follow the SOAP acronym
	•	Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan Model (SOAP)
	•	is a model for documenting the interaction with the patient that brings some repeatability, consistency and quality controls to how the interaction is conducted
	•	helps add a structure that produces a similar result for a similar interaction
	•	can be understood as an organizational breakdown of mostly text and narrative that the provider uses to record and interaction with the patient
	•	In addition to SOAP, the provider must also record procedure codes and diagnostic codes to bill the visit to an insurance program or funding source
	•	Once completed, the super-bill ends up with the billing department, where its information is entered into an electronic system (practice management system).
	•	SOAP Process:
	•	subjective discussion of the patients problems and reason for visit
	•	provider then revises and assesses the needs of the patient and creates a plan (instructions, prescriptions, labs, referrals, procedure orders or follow up visits)
	•	meaningful use requires the patient be able to receive a summary of his or her visit in a timely manner

	•	Inpatient Care
	•	Care inside an inpatient workflow can be infinitely complex (some planned, many not with many changes)
	•	Surgery is a common intervention that involves several different sub-departments operating in concert with each other to function smoothly.  
	•	pre-anesthesia drugs and sedatives
	•	shaving and marking prior
	•	surgery
	•	imaging technology during surgery
	•	communications throughout surgery
	•	post-anesthesia care unit
	•	At each step of the way, all of the activities, supplies and events occurring with the patient are documented in several forms that involve paperwork, dictation, and in some cases direct computer entry. 
	•	Those records find their way to the billing department into claims
	•	hospitals differ from outpatient facilities in that they typically contain both an on-premises pharmacy and an on-premises lab

	•	Inpatient / Outpatient Journey Difference
	•	Inpatient care is primarily centered around small and continuous increments of time, whereas outpatient care is centered around transactional visits or encounters with the patient
	•	Inpatient care typically operates on a larger scale, whereas outpatient facilities depend more on partnerships and referrals to outside parties.

	•	Labs
	•	operate typically with another electronic system (Laboratory Information System) distinct from the EHR
	•	The most common scenario for the performing laboratory is that orders come in as panels and results go out as individual test results organized in groupings that might or might not reflect how they were ordered.

	•	Imaging
	•	At small and medium-sized practices, the only common imaging equipment located on site is an individual X-ray machine and an ultrasound machine
	•	Typically at small or rural practices where a comprehensive imaging center is not readily available

	•	Administrating and Billing
	•	Without billing, the majority of medical practices cannot operate, so it is the heart of most site’s workflows. 
	•	Billing operations at medical practices also constitute the most complex workflows of any activity of any industry
	•	The codes selected by the providers during the interaction with the patient need to be cleaned up according to very complex rules and procedures defined by insurers or programs such as Medicare
	•	Many patients receive insurance from multiple carriers the teach might cover only a portion of the activities performed by the provider
	•	Billing departments, because of their importance, are also typically the administrative center of a practice and do the bulk of operational reporting
