Scarcity
by Sendhil Mullainathan

	•	Intro
	•	scarcity — having less than you feel you need
	•	scarcity changes us
	•	the coins ‘looked’ largest to poorer kids when asked to size 
	•	‘subjective expansion of time’ that comes with an increased engagement of attention
	•	in economics, scarcity is ubiquitous
	•	Feeling vs. having scarcity
	•	the feeling of scarcity is distinct from its physical reality
	•	Logic and Consequences of Scarcity
	•	What happens to our minds when we feel we have too little, and how does that shape our choices and our behaviors?
	•	When scarcity captures our attention, it changes how we think—whether it is at the level of milliseconds, hours, or days and weeks.
	•	A tight deadline or a shortage of cash focuses us on the task at hand. With our minds riveted, we are less prone to careless error. This makes perfect sense: scarcity captures us because it is important, worthy of our attention.
	•	bandwidth — mental capacity
	•	fluid intelligence — how we process and make decisions
	•	Being poor reduces a person’s cognitive capacity more than going one full night without sleep. It is not the poor that have less bandwidth as individuals. Rather, it is that the experience of poverty reduces anyone’s bandwidth.
	•	Scarcity captures our attention, and this provides a narrow benefit: we do a better job of managing and processing needs; but it costs us as we neglect other concerns and become less effective in the rest of life. 
	•	Focusing and Tunneling
	•	Scarcity forces all choices. Abstractions become concrete. 
	•	Scarcity can make us more effective
	•	midcourse correction — when you’re halfway through something and realize that you are running out of time
	•	deadlines are benefits if used correctly
	•	a deadline leads the current task to be top of mind
	•	when time is short, you get more out of it
	•	focus dividend — the positive outcome of scarcity capturing the mind
	•	“An Englishman’s mind works best when it is almost too late.” — Max Hastings
	•	Anecdotally, scarcity of any kind should yield a focus dividend
	•	Having fewer blueberries, the blueberry poor enjoyed a focus dividend. In a berry throwing game the blueberry rich made more, but the blueberry poor were more careful, therefore more accurate.
	•	focus dividend — heightened productivity when facing a deadline or the accuracy advantage of the blueberry poor—comes from our core mechanism: scarcity captures the mind (unavoidably and beyond our control). 
	•	imagery of a deadline will be just that, imagined
	•	scarcity can capture the mind when we are both thinking fast and thinking slow (Kahneman)
	•	Instead of saying that scarcity ‘focuses’ we could just as easily say that scarcity causes us to tunnel: to focus single-mindedly on managing the scarcity at hand
	•	focus is positive: focus on what seems important at the time
	•	tunneling is not: leads to tunnel and neglect other, possibly more important things
	•	goal inhibition — focusing on something that matters to you makes you less able to think about other things your care about. 
	•	goal inhibition is the mechanism underlying tunneling
	•	if scarcity-induced neglect is insensitive to the weighing of costs and benefits, we ought to see scarcity creating neglect even when it is detrimental to the person’s outcomes
	•	scarcity captures our minds automatically; and when it does, we do not make trade offs using a careful cost-benefit calculation. We tunnel on managing scarcity both to our benefit and to our detriment.
	•	Immediate scarcity looms large, and important things unrelated to it will be neglected. When we experience scarcity again and again, these omissions can add up.
	•	scarcity alters how we look at things, makes us choose differently 
	•	Bandwidth Tax
	•	bandwidth measures our computational capacity, our ability to pay attention, to make good decisions, to stick with our plans, and to resist temptation
	•	scarcity taxes bandwidth
	•	noise can hurt concentration, and performance and there are powerful effects of even a slight distraction
	•	scarcity generates internal disruptions…without realizing it, the brain’s resting state — the default network — tends to pull us away from what we are doing,  psychologist call this an ‘intentional blink’
	•	proactive inference — mentioning a word that means more to us makes us focus on that word
	•	scarcity affects our mental processor, by constantly loading the mind with other processes, it leaves less ‘mind' for the task at hand
	•	scarcity directly reduces bandwidth — not someone’s inherent capacity, but the capacity they have available for use
	•	cognitive capacity — psychological mechanisms that underlie our ability to solve problems, retain information, engage in logical reasoning, and so on.
	•	fluid intelligence — ability to think and reason abstractly and solve problems independent of any specific learning experience
	•	executive control — underlies our ability to manage our cognitive activities, including planning, attention, initiating and inhibiting actions, and controlling impulses
	•	Cognitive capacity and executive control are multifaceted and rich in nuance. Scarcity affects both.
	•	Our study revealed that simply raising monetary concerns for the poor erodes cognitive performance even more than being seriously sleep deprived
	•	just like the processor that is slowed down by too many applications, the poor here appear worse because some of their bandwidth is being used elsewhere (e.g. thinking about how I’m going to pay the bills this month). 
	•	many ingredients go into the manufacturing of self-control…it depends on how we weigh the future…and we appear to do so inconsistently
	•	“Once you realize that willpower is just a matter of learning how to control your attention and thoughts, you can really begin to increase it.”
	•	In studies, when we introduce a small tickle of scarcity, the subjects were suddenly more impulsive…beyond fluid intelligence, scarcity appears to reduce executive control
	•	Harvest
	•	“The same farmer is rich after harvest and poor before harvest”
	•	farmers don’t save properly and make worse decisions in times of excess and scarcity
	•	“The very state of having less money in the months before harvest makes farmers perform less intelligently and show less cognitive control”
	•	Poverty itself taxes the mind
	•	The poor have lower effective capacity than those who are well off. This is not because they are less capable, but rather because part of their mind is captured by scarcity
	•	Lonely
	•	The lonely show impaired bandwidth — in this case, less executive control
	•	those who feel lonely in their daily lives have a substantially higher consumption of fatty foods
	•	Worry
	•	worry consistently and predictably taxes bandwidth among rich and poor
	•	a taxed bandwidth leads to carelessness
	•	So much of what we attribute to talent or personality is predicated on cognitive capacity and executive control.
	•	All people, if they were poor, would have less effective bandwidth
	•	Scarcity makes us have fewer mental resources, it doesn’t make us make bad decisions, it just leaves us handicapped in decision making 
	•	Packing and Slack
	•	We have a ‘time suitcase’ that must fit our work, leisure, and family time. We have a money suitcase that must fit our housing, clothing and all our expenses.
	•	trade-off thinking and opportunity cost on time and money
	•	slack — space left unused
	•	slack comes from abundance, and can sometimes result in inefficiency and waste
	•	faced with over-abundance, sometimes people choose not to choose, and it is slack that leaves us free to do so
	•	slack not only absolves you of your need to make trade-offs, but it means mistakes do not entail real sacrifice
	•	planning fallacy — we are all too optimistic about future plans, especially when we have lot of slack
	•	slack gives room to fail
	•	temptation tax — is regressive and levied more heavily on those who have less
	•	our biases are not always responsive to the consequences, and they often persist if these consequences become extreme
	•	scarcity does not just mean less room to fail, it means a greater opportunity to fail
	•	scarcity raises the cost of error and provides more opportunity to err, to make misguided choices
	•	In our ‘time and money suitcases’ scarcity may create a logistically harder packing problem…and the mind, challenged by the psychology that emerges from scarcity, may find itself needing to navigate a world that is computationally more complex.
	•	Slack is not just inefficiency, it is a mental luxury
	•	the luxury of not having to think
	•	“A man rich in proportion to the number of things he can afford to let alone” 
	•	Expertise
	•	People act, at times, as if small amounts mean a lot
	•	this contradicts the standard economic model that states that the exchange rate between time and money ought to be constant
	•	perception is highly relative…therefore our view of a small amount may only be viewed in its context to its environment, relative to the background.
	•	expertise, a deeper understanding of the units, can alter perception
	•	the poor, in short, are the best experts in the value of a dollar…meaning, in some lenses, the poor are actually more rational than the rich
	•	abundance means freedom from trade-offs
	•	making the trade-off concrete requires tracing the money that was saved and understanding how it would have been spent
	•	thinking trade-offs under slack is like trying to have your cake and eat it too…since we do not actually make many trade-offs, they remain largely an invention. Without trade-offs the value of small amounts is not something you ever really need to bother yourself with
	•	frugal v poor think
	•	the frugal have a principled conscientiousness about money
	•	the poor must be vigilant about trade offs
	•	therefore the frugal rely more on context
	•	the poor are better at making ends meet today, they make the dollar go further

“There is nothing in the prospect of a sharp, unceasing battle for the bare necessities of life, to encourage looking ahead, everything to discourage the effort.”
	— Jacob Riis 
	•	Borrowing and Myopia
	•	borrowing goes hand in hand with scarcity
	•	“That initial bill she could not pay created scarcity. She then tunneled on making ends meet that month.”
	•	to attend to the future requires bandwidth, which scarcity taxes
	•	borrowing is a simple consequence of tunneling
	•	the poor actually are more efficient until the moment they borrow
	•	scarcity, in whatever form, always leads to borrowing
	•	much like an expensive loan, a hastily patched solution looks attractive within the tunnel
	•	scarcity and tunneling lead you to put off important but not urgent things, like cleaning your office, getting a colonoscopy, writing a will — that are easy to neglect. Their costs are immediate, loom large and are easy to defer, and their benefits fall outside the tunnel. 
	•	when in a tunnel, people are behaving myopically
	•	detaching from the moment and thinking ahead requires a wider perspective and some cognitive resources
	•	tunnels limit everyone’s vision

	•	The Scarcity Trap
	•	scarcity trap — situation where a person’s behavior contributes to their scarcity
	•	an initial scarcity is compounded by behaviors that magnify it
	•	Why are people reacting to these events last minute? Why are they treating scheduled events as shocks?
	•	juggling — constant move from one pressing task to the next; the logical consequence of tunneling
	•	with many bills in the air, we focus on the ball that is about to drop when we tunnel
	•	juggling is why predictable events appear like shocks
	•	resulting in a messy patchwork of assets and obligations
	•	“Portfolios of the Poor”
	•	leads to lower fluid intelligence and diminished executive control
	•	getting out of a scarcity trap requires formulating a plan, stepping outside the tunnel
	•	Escaping the scarcity trap does not merely require an occasional act of vigilance. It requires constant, everlasting vigilance; almost all temptations must be resisted at all times.
	•	…and researchers have likened willpower to a muscle, which fatigues with use. by this account, a persistent need to resist temptation would deplete, making it all the more difficult to escape the scarcity trap
	•	Like the busy person behind on his obligations, they seem to be fully aware that they were paying a steep price for living in the scarcity trap
	•	Many people report that a shock was the trigger for their renewed borrowing and eventual decline
	•	life at the bottom is volatile
	•	there is a need for instruments for buffering against shocks
	•	low-cost loan
	•	liquid savings account
	•	insurance 
	•	Poverty
	•	Common ingredients:
	•	tunneling
	•	borrowing
	•	lack of slack
	•	bandwidth tax
	•	discretion — provides a critical safety valve that can limit scarcity’s stress and damage
	•	this safety valve limits the damage and depth of the scarcity trap
	•	similar to a tourist seeing 4 sites in Rome rather than 14, they are happier and not overcommitted
	•	however, the poor cannot take a break from poverty
	•	a lack of discretion makes for a particularly extreme form of poverty
	•	discretion really is the difference between absolute vs. relative poverty
	•	money, because its fungible, can be used to compensate for other forms of scarcity
	•	alleviating scarcity of money is much harder
	•	Elephant: 
	•	why are the poor so bad in so many ways?
	•	medicine — while people at every income level may fail to take their medications, the poor do so more often
	•	attention — poor farmers leave money on table by not weeding enough
	•	parenting — the poor are worse parents, they are harsher, inconsistent, discontent and appear less loving
	•	fat — the poor in the US are more obese
	•	saving — the poor never save enough 
	•	prenatal — even if its free, they often do so improperly
	•	confront the elephant
	•	issues of access and cost play a role in the poor being poor at this, but there is more to the story
	•	the core of the problem is behavior…poverty — the scarcity mindset — causes failure
	•	the more parents have to juggle, the worse parents they are…good parenting requires bandwidth and freedom of mind. These are luxuries that the poor do not have.
	•	prospective memory — memory for things you planned to remember, like calling the doctor or paying bills…they get neglected when your bandwidth is reduced.
	•	How many poor people miss appointments? How can we assist their prospective memory?
	•	bandwidth can make sense of the diverse set of eremitical facts across behaviors, time and place
	•	to understand the poor, we must recognize that they focus and they tunnel and they make mistakes; that they lack not only money, but also bandwidth
 
	•	Improving the Lives of the Poor
	•	fault-tolerant programs — many programs built are designed not to be fault tolerant, magnifying mistakes, which were predictable, and essentially pushing people out the door. 
	•	skipping class in training programs
	•	linear classes do not accommodate the juggling poor
	•	fault-tolerant programs allows opportunities people receive to match the effort they put in and the circumstances they face
	•	be careful not to penalize without failing to motivate
	•	limits can be made more effective once we understand tunneling
	•	incentives that fall outside the tunnel are unlikely to work
	•	rewards and penalties in some distant future are less effective for those who tunnel
	•	we never ask, “Is this how we want our poor using their bandwidth?”
	•	we treat education like it doesn’t have a bandwidth tax for the poor.. “When a person is focusing on training, what is s/he not focusing on?”
 
	•	Managing Scarcity in Organizations
	•	Hospital
	•	more surgeries than operating rooms…St. Johns was stuck in a scarcity trap
	•	they were constantly behind and made people/doctors wait hours and have late night surgeries
	•	solution: leave one room unused
	•	the scarcity in rooms was an inability to accommodate emergencies, not a lack of surgery space
	•	the lack of rooms the hospital had was really a lack of slack
	•	an assistant is an important source of slack
	•	many ‘optimization’ focused organizations undervalue slack
	•	when the intangible future comes face to face with he palpable present, slack feels like a luxury. 
	•	when you face scarcity, slack is a necessity
	•	to have someone underused can be valuable
	•	slack v. fat
	•	by increasing leverage (debt) and reducing fat, managers spend more wisely
	•	slack is both wasteful and beneficial
	•	cut too much fat, remove too much slack, and you are left with manager who will mortgage the future to make ends meet today
	•	too tight of deadlines can create long hours, but it can also create destructive tunneling, mistakes will be made as a consequence of the tunneling.
	•	NASA crash happened because crucial checks were neglected because they were important but not urgent
	•	firefighting trap — too many problems, not enough time. solve urgent problems but put off non-urgent ones. leads to a cascade so that they amount of work to be done grows.
	•	time is spent fighting immediate fire, with new fires constantly popping up because no one is preventing them
	•	solution: explicitly manage and ensure the availability of slack and monitor risk
	•	ensure that people aren’t borrowing resources from future projects for present projects
	•	constantly a battle of balancing bandwidth tax on performance with time scarcity
	•	shorter work weeks lead to better job performance
	•	Hospital EG:
	•	dealing with more patients quickly lowered quality, patients were more likely to die; in fact even the benefits did not persist…a sustained increase in workload eventually led to an increase in time it took to manage each patient
	•	with prolonged scarcity, bandwidth taxes tend to accumulate
	•	as work hours accumulate and sleep time diminishes, productivity eventually goes down
	•	yet most firms still manage hours and not bandwidth
	•	increasing work hours, working people harder, forgoing vacations, and so on are tunneling responses, like borrowing at high interest. they ignore long-term consequences.
	•	organization must be insightful, creating environments conducive to the successful management of scarcities challenges
	•	Businesses often succeed and fail as a function of how they manage scarcity
 
	•	Scarcity in Everyday Life
	•	time-debt trap — tight calendars leaves you on the edge of being late to everything
	•	five minutes before every meeting, a doctor’s assistant comes in and says, “Hey, 5 minutes left.” to help the doc better manage time scarcity.
	•	change the environment to counteract the psychology of wanting to talk to people longer…rumble strips
	•	influence what is in the tunnel to combat scarcity
	•	reminders are powerful and often under-appreciated, perhaps because they are so obvious
	•	when there is neglect, it is often more effective to alter the outcome it leads to rather than fight it
	•	non-automated tasks are really hard to remember
	•	we can think of choices as coming in one of two varieties: vigilance and one off
	•	whenever possible, convert vigilant tasks to one-off actions. many banal tasks have this structure
	•	navigate so that bad choices are harder to make in a single moment of tunneling, and arrange it so that good behaviors require little vigilance yet are occasionally re-evaluated
	•	Bandwidth is about allocating our limited information processing abilities. Decisions that demand more information processing have immediate bandwidth implications.
	•	How do we simplify healthcare decision making?
	•	clear and simple syntheses are a terrific way to economize on cognitive capacity
	•	far fewer customers took payday loans when they say the interest in dollars and not interest
	•	bandwidth varies over time…understand the bandwidth timeline (paychecks?)
	•	weigh tasks and meetings by the bandwidth required…to protect high-bandwidth time
	•	families with no college experience tripled their submission rate if they received help in filling out the forms to get their kids into college.
	•	Mis-planning, procrastination, and forgetting can turn seemingly minor steps into major stumbling blocks. Yet we overlook these snags when structuring or crafting policies for others.
	•	We frequently design programs aimed at people who are bandwidth-stretched that charge a log in bandwidth.
	•	solution: automatically fill out forms using previously saved data
	•	scarcity often begins with abundance
	•	deadlines are often under appreciated…in a world of scarcity, long deadlines are a recipe for trouble. Early abundance encourages waste. 
	•	solution: break abundance-then-scarcity cycle by evening it out, create long periods of moderation rather than spurts of abundance followed by heightened periods of scarcity. Insert a little slack.
 
	•	Conclusion
	•	cognitively tired and the science of scarcity
	•	Like most workers in modern society, we use our minds to make our living, yet we know remarkably little bout our minds’ daily rhythms
	•	productivity depends crucially on bandwidth, workers must work effectively, managers manage well, etc…
	•	How cheaply, unobtrusively and effectively we can use technology to address problems create by bandwidth. 
	•	experience of scarcity near a deadline usually emerges because of how time was managed during abundance
