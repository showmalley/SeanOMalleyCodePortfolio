On Grand Strategy
by John Lewis Gaddis

	•	Crossing the Hellespont
	•	“if you were to take account of everything…you would never do anything. It is better to have a brave heart and endure one half of the terrors we dread than to calculate all of the terrors and suffer nothing at all…big things are won by big danger.” — Xerxes
	•	Hedgehogs
	•	relate everything to a single central vision through which all they say and do has significance
	•	Foxes
	•	pursue many ends, often unrelated and even contradictory, connected, if at all, only in some de facto way
	•	two ways to become intellectually indelible (unable to be forgotten):
	•	be Delphic (ambiguous)
	•	be Aesopian (don’t cope with reality) use metaphors heavily
	•	commanders must distinguish where they can act from what they must accept, trusting only in such craft as circumstances allow. Xerxes, in contrast, reshapes environments.
	•	The shortsighted Artabanus sees so much on the immediate horizon that complexity itself is the enemy. The farsighted Xerxes sees only a distant horizon on which ambitions are opportunities.
	•	how experts thought — their style of reasoning — did matter
	•	foxes were far more proficient predictors than hedgehogs
	•	foxes relied, for their predictions, on an intuitive ‘stitching together of diverse sources of information,’ but they tended to be too discursive — too inclined to qualify their claims to hold and audience.
	•	hedgehogs shunned self-depreciation and brushed aside criticism. Aggressively deploying big explanations.
	•	Xerxes failed, as is the habit of hedgehogs, to establish a proper relationship between his ends and his means…because ends only exist in one’s imagination. Means though, are stubbornly finite. Ends and means have to connect if anything is to happen. They’re never, however, interchangeable.
	•	little things can add up in unpredictably big ways — and yet, leaders can’t let uncertainties paralyze them. They must appear to know what they are doing, even when they don’t.
	•	F. Scott Fitzgerald’s test for first-rate intelligence:
	•	“the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the same time, and still retain the ability to function”
	•	Some people are neither hedgehogs nor foxes, some are both
	•	“…for what choices would we have if stuck within categories, mimicking animals, that mandated predictability…intelligence requires opposites, if freedom is choosing, then priorities can’t be predetermined. 
	•	we need to combine the hedgehog’s sense of direction and the fox’s sensitivity to surroundings
	•	reconstituting the past as histories, biographies, poems, plays, novels or films…the best of these sharpen and shade simultaneously
	•	choice always has characteristics of being inevitable and unpredictable
	•	and infinite number of possibilities exist at an indeterminate number of cells, all simultaneously
	•	Abe Lincoln has an ecological sensitivity that equally respects time, space and scale
	•	short term sensitivity to surroundings with a long term sense of direction (‘fast’ and ‘slow’ thinking)
	•	ends can be infinite, but means can never be
	•	It is wrong to say that states have grand strategies, but people don’t. Alignments are necessary across time, space and scale
	•	Lincoln and Shakespeare had a lifetime to become who they were. Young people today don’t, because society segregates education, worsening the necessary ‘intellectual capital’ needed for leaders to be good at what they do when they arrive to the top.
	•	A plan, informed by the past, linked to the present, for achieving some goal
	•	There are known unknowns, and unknown unknowns; friction is created at the collision of theory with reality
	•	Lincoln knew where is compass was heading, whatever the unknowns that lied between him and his destination, he had in mind a range of options for dealing with these, based on hard-won lessons from this who have gone before, the rest was up to him
	•	training is the best protection we have against strategies getting stupider as they become grander, a recurring problem in peace as well as in war.
	•	to teach common sense
	•	teach the basics, build stamina, enforce discipline, encourage collaboration, show you how to fail and to recover from failure. 
	•	leaders who have reached the top can become prisoners of their own preeminence, they lock themselves into roles from which they cannot escape
	•	grand strategies — alignments of means with ends — become possible when leadership and common sense have frequent crossing between them

	•	Long Walls
	•	Unlike the Persians, the Greeks knew only scarcity, therefore they differed in all respects, accepting scarcity required specialization
	•	“knowledge of the past as an aid to understanding of the future, which in the course of human things must resemble if it does not reflect it.”
	•	the past we can know only from imperfect sources, the future, we can’t know, other than that it will originate in the past, but then depart from it
	•	Small causes can have big negative consequences, but progress forward takes place warily
	•	Peloponnesian War — the unintended result of constructing a culture to support a strategy
	•	need to create a culture focused on a cohesive grand strategy
	•	Athens
	•	the assembly functioned by divorcing virtue from status. If a man wished to participate — a virtue — then the ‘obscurity of his condition — status — wouldn’t prevent his doing so
	•	The greeks thought of culture as character. The behavior of a city, state, or a people in small things, big things, and those in between
	•	Pericles was not Xerxes. “I am more afraid of our own blunders than of the enemy’s devices”
	•	Fear inspired by the growth of the Athenian power caused the Peloponnesian War
	•	Pericles was first steered with flows — a strategy of persuasion…but persuasion, pursued with patience, would have come closer to cultivation
	•	Building walls and proclaiming perimeters can be rational choices, for it makes little sense to pursue lost causes with limited resources. But strategy isn’t always a rational enterprise.
	•	The abstractions of strategy and the emotions of strategists can never be separated: they can only be balanced
	•	If credibility is always in doubt, then capabilities must become infinite or bluffs must become routine. Neither approach is sustainable: thats why walls exist in the first place. They buffer what’s important from what’s not
	•	Admiral Stansfield Turner…a man with flexible views on credentials but firm ones on the relevance of the classics of contemporary affairs

	•	Teachers and Tethers
	•	Sun Tzu, sets forth principles, selected for validity across time and space, and then connects them to practices, bound by time and space. The Art of War is neither history nor biography, but a compilation of precepts, procedures and categorical claims.
	•	“The fish which covets bait is caught; troops who covet bait are defeated”
	•	“They will understand the futility of shoveling shit uphill”
	•	Master Sun reflects but then acts, deploying maximum leverage against minimal resistance. Success comes as quickly as the least expenditure of resources and lives allow.
	•	“simplicity coexists with complexity and can guide us through it”
	•	Musical notes are only five in number, but their melodies are so numerous that one cannot hear them all.
	•	No one can anticipate everything that might happen. Sensing possibilities, though, is better than having no sense at all of what to expect.
	•	Seek common sense by tethering a few principles to many practices. If tethered to principles, we need not be paralyzed. We learn to tether by having great teachers.
	•	Know the difference between inheriting a title and mastering the art of command. The first can happen overnight, the second can take a lifetime.
	•	Octavian remained focused on not winding up in a bloody heap on the senate floor, that required self-assessment
	•	From a position of strength, Octavian worried about his weaknesses
	•	“To remove a rival was to remove a potential ally”
	•	Octavian arrived, viewed the body, asked the men to behave better in the future, and proceeded to hand out allocations. His calm so shamed the former troops that they demanded the murders’ punishment
	•	Octavian had a sense to delegate his authority, not to try to exercise it where he doubted his own competence
	•	Octavian was thinking ahead; how one decision can be made to affect what happens next
	•	Octavian never tried to forge, form contingent events, causal chains…instead he seized opportunities while retaining objectives, he saw next steps
	•	Octavian rarely confused aspirations with capabilities, and he was always more careful, deploying strengths and in compensating for weaknesses
	•	“Offer an enemy a bait to lure him; feign disorder and strike hime…When he concentrates, prepare against him; where he is strong, avoid him…pretend inferiority and encourage his arrogance…keep him under a strain and wear him down.”
	•	“Victories must connect, otherwise they lead no where”
	•	“Plants aren’t aware that they are being made to mature in a certain way, but if firmly rooted and carefully tended they’ll cooperate.”

	•	Souls and States
	•	Augustine never regarded himself as a saint, undergoing a slow and painful conversion to Christianity
	•	Theological training was less important than firmness of will, persuasiveness in rhetoric, and the pragmatism necessary to get things done.
	•	Augustine set out to reconcile faith with reason. The confessions began the journey with a self-imposed public humiliation, leaving all the more room for his subsequent work to soar
	•	Man must manage unknowns, for God has endowed him — or cursed him — with free will. That is the price of original sin, but it’s also the opportunity that allows hope: human existence  need not be pointless: man isn’t at the mercy of capricious gods.
	•	The genius of Augustine is that he concerns himself more with tensions than their sources: order versus justice, war versus peace, Caesar versus God. He creates polarities as gravitational forces without trying to say what gravity is.
	•	He’s comfortable, to a point, with contradictions…making his teachings procedural, not absolute.
	•	For all the harshness in rooting out heretics, Augustine preferred persuasion on issues of war and peace
	•	A larger piece is that Augustine never appeared wholeheartedly a monotheist. He worshipped Reason as much as he worshipped God, but he never showed God to be any more bound by Reason than Jupiter had been: “The two roles are quite incompatible.” This is where Augustine was uncomfortable with contradictions.
	•	Augustine regards military service as necessary to sustain the state with out which Christianity can’t survive
	•	Machiavelli had a first-rate intelligence — holding in mind while functioning — and that Augustine, for all his diligence, fell short. 
	•	Machiavelli found “lightness of being” bearable. For Augustine, it was un-endurable
	•	virtu — planning without praying
	•	“Lightness of Being” is the ability, if not to find the good in bad things, then at least to remain afloat among them, perhaps to swim or to sail through them, possibly even to take precautions that can keep you dry. It’s not to locate logic in misfortunes, or to show that they’re for the best because they reflect God’s will. That’s for Augustine the hedgehog, the ponderous Pangloss of his day.
	•	Panglossian — character in voltaire whom is unreasonably optimistic and naive
	•	Aspirations are not always capabilities, despite how we often try to connect them with checklists
	•	Machiavelli was one of the founding thinkers of utilitarianism.
	•	Borja didn’t just sack his subordinates: he disassembled them and displayed the pieces. The shock and awe accomplished its purpose: at the cost of one life, others were saved that would have been lost if a new revolt had broken out. 
	•	“If you have to use force, don’t destroy what you are trying to preserve”
	•	“Justice is no more reasonable than what a person’s prudence tells him he must acquire for himself, or must submit to, because men cannot afford justice in any sense that transcends their own preservation.”
	•	“A prince can never secure himself among the people, for they are too many. He can however, secure himself among the great, because they are few.”
	•	utilitarian morality — proportioning your actions to your objective, not to progress from one nebulous city to another, but because some things have been shown to work an others haven’t”
	•	…Where Augustine is a closeted polytheist, uneasily juggling the incompatibility of God and Reason
	•	You proportion aspirations to capabilities. These are opposites — the first being free from limits and the second being bound by them — but they must connect. That happens only when you hold both in mind simultaneously.
	•	Augustine’s City of God no longer exists on earth. The City of Man, which survives, has no single path to salvation. The belief that the correct, objectively valid solution to the question of how men should live can in principle be discovered, is itself in principle not true.
	•	The roots of toleration: “historically the product of the realization of the irreconcilability of equally dogmatic faiths, and the practical improbability of complete victory of one over the other.

	•	Princes as Pivots
	•	Phillip II rushes from crisis to crisis, rarely resting, never fully in control. He’s whacking moles, and they pop up everywhere. Elizabeth, in contrast, refuses to hurry. She’ll whack when she has to, but she resists unnecessary expenditures of resources, energy, reputation, and — unusual for a monarch — virginity.
	•	Phillip II was unable to see past the responsibilities that engulfed him and, as a consequence, the paperwork swamped him. While Elizabeth freely delegated so that she had time to strategize and remain clear of mind.
	•	Phillip II failed to see incompatibles, and hence the need to pursue certain objectives at the expense of others. The king resisted prioritizing ends, even though God himself had chosen to selectively provide means
	•	Elizabeth’s lightness allowed flirtation, which costs less than obligation, whether to suiters or the their realms
	•	Pivoting requires gyroscopes. Elizabeth balanced purposefulness with imagination, guile, humor, timing, and an economy in movement that, however extravagant her display, kept her steady on the tightrope she walked. She, without visible effort, retained the initiative in all she did. She never felt not up to her role.
	•	Machiavelli, thinking gyroscopically, advised his prince to be a lion and a fox, the former to frighten wolves, the latter to detect snares. Elizabeth went him one better, by being a lion, a fox and female. 
	•	For Phillip II, micromanaging an empire on which the sun never set tended to blur his vision
	•	hendiadys — 
	•	a complex idea expressed by two words connected by a copulative conjunction … how two things become one
	•	the expression of a single idea by two words connected with “and,” e.g., nice and warm, when one could be used to modify the other, as in nicely warm.
	•	The church, more than anyone suspects, masters contradictions and therefore links the cities of God and Man. Counterfactuals, like ghosts, should haunt historians.

	•	New Worlds
	•	Assuming stability is one of the ways ruins get made, resilience accommodates the unexpected
	•	The absence of close control by the British crown in the early stages of colonization left considerable latitude for the evolution of those forms of government that seemed most appropriate  to the people actively involved in the process of overseas enterprise and settlement
	•	Controlled environments encourage complacency, making it hard to cope when controls break down as they sooner or later must. Constant disruptions, however, prevent recuperation,  nothing is ever healthy. There is a balance then, between integrative and disintegrative processes in the natural world — and edge of chaos, so to speak — where adaptation, especially self-organization, tends to occur. New political worlds work similarly.
	•	Elizabeth would have found her successor’s efforts to reconcile opposites dangerously foolish. She understood political horticulture: that things grow best when variety is allowed and roots aren’t too closely examined.
	•	Jefferson was a genius because he could conceal contradictions in abstractions
	•	Governments should balance dissatisfactions, set precedents rather than be bound by them and prefer proportionality to consistency
	•	The American experiment was “whether societies of men are really capable or not of establishing good government from reflection and choice, or whether they are forever destined to depend for their political constitutions on accident and force.
	•	No strategy anticipates all contingencies, that every solution creates new problems, and that these can, at times, overwhelm. 
	•	Knowing the need to proportion aspirations to capabilities, recognizing the incompatibilities in good things, they chose to save their new state, and leave it to their descendants the saving of its soul. (US and slavery)
	•	By balancing internal interests, external expansion can occur
	•	Bolivar argued that New Spain had political immaturity because Spain had so tightly controlled its territories as to keep them in a “permanent infancy” unable to command self-respect.

	•	The Grandest Strategists
	•	The novice cannot pass through these layers of increasing intensity of danger without sensing that here ideas are governed by other factors, that the light of reason is refracted in a manner quite different from that which is normal in academic speculation.
	•	Clausewitz’s novice discovers that combat defies common sense,. In time though, logic surrounds, confounds, and supersedes such grammar. Heroics drain you. Offensives slow as supply lines lengthen. Dogs that catch cars never know what to do with them. 
	•	Common sense is indeed like oxygen: the higher you go, the thinner it gets. As each triumph topped its antecedent, Napoleon’s grammar became less logic. Like Caesar, he rose so far above fundamentals as to lose sight of them altogether. Such ascents can be awe-inspiring: so too, in their day, were hot air balloons. But gravity is always present.
	•	Given the diversity of the real world, the application of principle rather than low allows for a grater latitude of judgment. Tolstoy, seeks at such length to subvert all laws.
	•	War is an act of force to compel our enemy to do our will
	•	The maximum use of force is in no way incompatible with the simultaneous use of intellect
	•	Where two ideas form a true logical antithesis…then fundamentally, each is implied in the other
	•	ecological sensibility — the man responsible for evaluating the whole must bring to the task the quality of intuition that perceives the truth at every point. Otherwise chaos of opinions would arise, and fatally entangle judgement
	•	Planning can only anticipate surprises by living with contradictions
	•	As each man’s strength…no longer responds to his will, the inertia of the whole gradually comes to rest on the commander’s will alone. The ardor of his spirit must rekindle the flame of purpose in all others; his inward fire must revive their hope.
	•	Xerxes and Napoleon each went wrong in that they failed to perceive “truth at every point,” which in these instances meant landscapes, logistics, climates, the morale of their troops and the strategies of their enemies.
	•	The good general must know friction in order to overcome it whenever possible, and in order not to expect a standard of achievement in his operations which this very friction makes impossible.
	•	Beware of the rarity of common sense at high altitude
	•	Kutuzov, he knows, will never invent anything, but he’ll listen to everything, remember everything, put everything in its place, won’t hinder anything useful or allow anything harmful. He understands that there is something stronger and more significant than his will — the inevitable course of events — and he’s able to see them, able to understand their significance, and, in view of that significance, is able to renounce…his personal will, and direct it elsewhere. He keeps his head out of his own clouds.
	•	Leaders must keep their feet on the ground, whenever the thread became too thin I have preferred to break it off…just as some plants only bear fruit if they don’t shoot up too high
	•	Those who never rise above anecdote — those indefatigable repeaters of pointless stories — are usually useless, for they “would construct all history of individual cases..digging only as deep as suits them, never getting down to the general factors that govern the matter.
	•	Theory becomes an excuse through which “limited and ignorant minds…justify their congenital incompetence. Clausewitz especially despises the “jargon, techicalities, and metaphors” that swarm at high altitudes, a “lawless rabble of camp followers torn from context and enlisted as principles. “The light of day usually reveals them as mere trash,” making theory “the very opposite of practice, and not infrequently the laughing stock of men whose military competence is beyond dispute.”
	•	Paradoxical trinity:
	•	passions that cause combatants to lose their lives
	•	skill of their commanders
	•	coherence of their political objectives for which the war is being fought
	•	Each situation requires a balancing derived from judgement and arising from experience, skills acquired by learning from the past and training for the future
	•	Theory serves practice and when practice corrects theory — when it removes theorists’ horse blinders — it returns the favor, preventing stumbles off cliffs, into swamps, and toward Moscow
	•	Modern term for stretching in strategy is “net assessment”
	•	knowns
	•	probabilities
	•	unknowns
	•	ends, potentially infinite, can never be means, which are poignantly finite
	•	overstretch — the enfeeblement that comes with confusing ends and means — allows enemies to apply leverage, small maneuvers having big consequences

	•	The Greatest President
	•	When asked to specify his education, Abe Lincoln wrote a single word, “defective”
	•	Lincoln perfected performance: no one used humor more readily, more aptly, or with less recycling. His anecdotes, often scatological, flowed as easily as the paper the shaky banks of his day issued as currency, but the stories never lacked point or purpose: it was said of Lincoln that he could “make a cat laugh.” Behind the mask though was an enduring fatalism, as if something or someone else — probably not God — were directing him.
	•	He educated himself, he read voraciously, remembered pragmatically, and applied lessons ingeniously.
	•	Lincoln embraced a cause, acquired a compass and set a course 
	•	Lincoln started his speeches slowly, appearing at first to search for thoughts, words, even the more distant parts of his own anatomy. But as he warmed up, his gestures became purposeful, his voice began to carry, and his arguments laid lethal traps…with a relentless geometrical logic.
	•	Lincoln drew strengths from contradictions, maybe because he contained so many. They gave him amplitude — physically, intellectually, morally — absent in his rival
	•	“If we could first know where we are, and whither we are tending, we could then better judge what to do, and how to do it”
	•	Lincoln’s moral standard didn’t arise from faith, or formal ethics, or even the law, a profession necessarily pragmatic in its pursuit of justice. It emerged instead from what experience had taught, from the self education that widened it, and from the logic in which Lincoln grounded his oratorical lightning. Judge Douglas’s amorality, therefore, was not just wrong: it violated the most basic requirements of common sense.
	•	As far as I know, Lincoln never read Augustine or Machiavelli on the competing demands of souls and states. Yet few who came after them more skillfully navigated the polarity.
	•	“he wanted God on his side, but he must have Kentucky”
	•	means can never be considered in isolation of purpose
	•	Lincoln critically assessed costs, neither brushing them aside, nor dreading them to the point of immobility
	•	No one more artfully stuck to non-negotiables while selectively stating them
	•	“I shall do less whenever I shall believe what I am doing hurts the cause, and I shall do more whenever I shall believe doing more will help the cause. I shall try to correct errors when shown to be errors; and I shall adopt new views so fast as they shall appear to be true views.”
	•	Lincoln admitted, “I don’t know anything about diplomacy, I will be very apt to make blunders”
	•	Somehow he managed to be strong-willed without being willful, righteous without being self-righteous, and moral without being moralistic, thus yielding a psychological maturity unmatched in the history of American public life. He started small, rose slowly, and only when ready, reached for the top. His ambitions grew as his opportunities expanded, but he kept both within his circumstances. He sought to be underestimated.
	•	He wrote in a journal, “it is quite possible that God’s purpose is something different from the purpose of either party, perhaps, God wills this contest and wills that it shall not end yet.”
	•	gradual expansion of edges better equips leaders for the unexpected than those that shock, leaving little time to adapt, or those that inherited, which breed entitlement and arrogance, its companion
	•	the interdependence of time, space and scale simultaneously reflect choice and necessity: the illusion of agency causes us to believe in free will even as inexorable laws deny the possibility
	•	space is where expectations and circumstances intersect
	•	scale sets the ranges in which experience accrues
	•	time was kept on his side, Lincoln knew how to wait, when to act, and where to seek reassurance 

	•	Last Best Hope
	•	The Great War saw instances at all levels of intentions projected beyond capabilities, a frequent cause of past military calamities. But capabilities, this time, also outran intentions. Those in command grossly underestimated the lethality they commanded.
	•	This new war’s participants had to find purposes for which to die as it was killing them
	•	“Unversed in European politics, Wilson devoted himself to the pursuit of theories which had little relation to the emergencies of the hour.”
	•	Wilson aroused expectations without ways to meet them, he confused strengths with hopes and was too inclined to postpone what he couldn’t resolve.
	•	“The capitalist addiction to immediate gains diverted them from more distant destinations…they focused so compulsively on compasses that they sank into swamps and fell of cliffs”
	•	Ideological impurity was less important to FDR than geography, balances of power, and the requirements of navies.
	•	Roosevelt didn’t so much distrust experts as lament their limited horizons…they failed to see the larger possibilities that cam with a wider view.
	•	Roosevelt had “countervailing qualities of rare and inspiring order”
	•	He was large-hearted and possessed wide political horizons, imaginative sweep, understanding of the time in which he lived and of the direction of the great new forces at work in the twentieth century — technological, racial, imperialist, anti-imperialists; somewhat utilitarian, but absolutely fearless
	•	Convey to those citizens, “a sense of understanding of their inner needs, of responding to their own deepest impulses, above all of being alone capable of organizing the world along lines for which they are instinctively groping”

	•	Isaiah
	•	Isaiah Berlin
	•	“I hate discontinuities of all kinds”
	•	“I must obviously create my own job”
	•	“…as we sat on the garden patio with our drinks, I fell at once under the spell of his brilliant intellect
	•	obdurate — stubbornly refusing to change one's opinion or course of action.
	•	Anna Akhmatova
	•	“He will not be a beloved husband to me, but what we accomplish he and I, will disturb the twentieth century”
	•	Russian artists always suffered under authoritarians, but in trying to suppress creativity the tzars had focused it
	•	Problems could be solved through ‘the conscious application of truths upon which all men endowed with adequate mental powers could agree
	•	Consistency in grand strategy, then, was less a matter of logic than of scale: what made no sense to subordinates could make perfect sense to him. For he saw better than anyone the relationship of everything else — while sharing what he saw with no one.
	•	FDR: “A second class intellect, but a first-class temperament”
	•	“grand strategy” will remain unaffected by the unforseen
	•	Why don’t you ever see tightrope walkers without long poles? Because they are stabilizers that work by feel and not by thought: focusing on them risks fallings. Temperament functions similarly, I think, in strategy. It’s not a compass — that’s intellect. But it is a gyroscope: an inner ear complementing inward eye
	•	Octavian rose by teaching himself self control. Antony sank by forgetting it.
	•	positive liberty — need to make choices by yielding them to some higher authority, carried to extremes, let to tyranny
	•	negative liberty — preserved freedom to make choices, cultivating contradictions without a compass
	•	The best leaders had the humility to be unsure of what lay ahead, the flexibility to adjust to it and the ingenuity to accept, perhaps even leverage, inconsistencies. They respected topographies, crafted choices within them, and evaluated these carefully once made.
	•	pluralism — a recognition, for sure, of persisting evils — man’s fallen state, Augustine might have said — but also of the good that can come from balancing them — man’s state, Machiavelli might have replied. Provided we don’t too much sweat living with the contradictions that, as Berlin did say, have “never given men peace since”
	•	Not all praiseworthy things are simultaneously possible. and learning to live within that condition — let’s call it history — requires adaption to incompatibles
	•	grand strategy — the alignment of potentially infinite aspirations with necessarily limited capabilities…bending the alignment toward freedom
