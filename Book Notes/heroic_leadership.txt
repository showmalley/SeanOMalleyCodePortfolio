Heroic Leadership
by Chris Lowney

	•	Of Jesuits and JP Morgan
	•	“poverty, as the strong wall of religious life, should be loved”
	•	Loyola and his colleagues were convinced that we perform our best in supportive, encouraging and positively charged environments, and he exhorted his managers to create environments within to have “greater love than fear.”
	•	Leadership is not reserved for a few Poo-Bahs sitting atop large companies, nor do leadership opportunities arise only “on stage” at work
	•	The four pillars of Jesuit success
	•	self-awareness
	•	ingenuity 
	•	love
	•	heroism
	•	The Jesuits molded leaders who
	•	understood their strengths, weaknesses, values, and worldview
	•	confidently innovated and adapted to embrace a changing world
	•	engaged others with a positive loving attitude
	•	energized themselves and others through heroic ambitions

	•	What Leaders Do
	•	The leader who figures out where we need to go, points us in the right direction, gets us to agree that we need to get there, and rallies us through the inevitable obstacles that separate us from the promised land
	•	Jesuit leadership rejects quick-fix approaches that equate leadership with mere technique and tactics, scrapping “command and control” models that rely on one great person to lead the rest
	•	We’re all leaders, and we’re leading all the time, well or poorly
	•	Leadership springs from within. It’s about who I am as much as what I do
	•	Leadership is not an act. It is a way of living
	•	Leadership is an asymptotic process
	•	The Jesuit model explodes the “one great man” model for the simple reason that everyone has influence, and everyone projects influence — good or bad, large or small — all the time
	•	A person who understands what he or she wants, who is anchored by certain principles, and who faces the world with a consistent outlook. Leadership behavior develops naturally once this internal foundation has been laid. If it hasn’t been, mere technique can never compensate.
	•	The jesuit way of proceeding is a compass, not a checklist. If you know where you’re heading, the compass is an infinitely more valuable instrument
	•	By knowing what you value and what you want to achieve, you can orient yourself to any new environment, adapting confidently in unfamiliar circumstances
	•	Jesuit leaders became leaders by
	•	understanding their strengths, weaknesses, values, and worldview
	•	confidently innovating and adapting to embrace a changing world
	•	engaging others with a positive, loving attitude
	•	energizing themselves and others through heroic ambitions
	•	“Leaders thrive by understanding who they are and what they value, by becoming aware of unhealthy blind spots or weaknesses that can derail them, and by cultivating the habit of continuous self-reflection and learning”
	•	Research increasingly suggests that IQ and technical skills are far less crucial to leadership success than mature self-awareness
	•	“Living with one foot raised”
	•	A leader must rid himself of ingrained habits, prejudices, cultural preferences, and the “we’ve always done it this way” attitude
	•	“Leaders face the world with a confident, healthy sense of themselves as endowed with talent, dignity, and the potential to lead. They find exactly these same attributes in others and passionately commit to honoring and unlocking the potential they find in themselves and in others. They create environments bound and energized by loyalty, affection and mutual support.”
	•	“Leaders imagine an inspiring future and strive to shape it rather than passively watching the future happen around them. Heroes extract gold from opportunities at hand rather than waiting for golden opportunities to be handed to them.”

	•	An Accidental Company
	•	Leaders are ‘born twice’ individuals who endure major events that lead to a sense of separateness, or perhaps estrangement, from their environments. As a result, they turn inward in order to reemerge with a created rather than an inherited sense of identity.
	•	When Loyola was figuring out what he wanted to do, his self-awareness is what drew Europe’s finest to him.
	•	Loyola’s core appeal was not his own leadership traits — it was his ability to identify and unlock others’ latent leadership potential.
	•	One who truly lives under obedience is fully disposed to execute instantly and unhesitatingly whatever is enjoined him, no matter to him whether it be very hard to do.
	•	“Un-interupted life of heroic deeds and heroic virtues”
	•	Loyola has virtually no tangible accomplishments to show for almost 2/3 of his life.
	•	Without the setbacks, crises, and challenges that punctuated Loyola’s real life, he might never have grappled with who he was, what we wanted, what personal resources he had, and why he had failed along the way. Only by asking and answering those questions does one develop personal leadership capacity.
	•	Success flows from the undying commitment and persistence of many, not the isolated efforts of one.

	•	Leadership Role Models
	•	Goes survived the worst of the journey, only to die a thousand miles short of Beijing. He never found the Kingdom of Cathay, because China was Cathay.
	•	History readily celebrates those who literally put places on the map, however there is only a quick slide into oblivion for those who came away empty, or those like Goes, who removed places like Cathay from the map.
	•	The measure of personal greatness is less what they found at journey’s end and more the depth of human character that carried them along the way: their imagination, will, perseverance, courage, resourcefulness and willingness to bear the risk of failure.
	•	Goes’ story re-defines leadership success by illustrating how one need not make a big, visible, self-aggrandizing ‘win’ to be successful; sometimes success in the form of a contribution that helps the team win.
	•	inculturation — assimilation of a host culture
	•	Jesuits should become experts not only in theology and philosophy, the discipline everyone expects priests to master, but also in languages, mathematics and the sciences
	•	“he relentlessly pursued his passion for astronomy throughout his remaining years”
	•	quixotic — exceedingly idealistic
	•	Scientists needed to accept the facts and set about finding a credible theory to explain them.
	•	On Clavius S.J. … “His writing is elegant, a simple testimony to his intellectual integrity and seemingly unwavering commitment to the truth”
	•	None of the great leaders in the book ever managed more than a handful of others, they led themselves, they didn’t shrink from the task, the first and most crucial leadership challenge that every leader must face
	•	Redefined Leaders
	•	are always teaching and learning
	•	mold brilliant and eminent men and women
	•	persevere
	•	energize themselves by the sheer ambition of their heroic goals
	•	innovate by approaching their challenges in ways their predecessors never imagined
	•	devote themselves to excellence
	•	remain open to new ideas, even in old age
	•	honor truth above egos
	•	influence others by their example, their ideas and their coaching
	•	We do not have a defining “moment,” rather, a pattern is slowly etched through a lifetime studded with ordinary opportunities to make subtle differences

	•	To Order One’s Life
	•	Only those that know their weaknesses can deal with them or even hope to conquer them
	•	An introspective journey involves:
	•	appreciating oneself as talented
	•	identifying personal, derailing baggage that prevents the realization of full potential, especially weakness that manifest themselves as habitual tendencies
	•	articulating personally motivating goals and ambitions
	•	determining what one stands for
	•	developing a worldview that guides interaction with others
	•	acquiring the habit of updating oneself regularly on all the above
	•	The jesuits kept growing rapidly by not growing too rapidly
	•	Largely self-managing work roles with a big picture that is anything but predictable
	•	Those who can learn, innovate, exercise good judgment, take responsibility for their actions, and take risks are those who thrive in constantly changing environments.
	•	We know what we want leaders to do: Establish direction and vision, motivate teams to pursue goals, smash through obstacles and produce change for the better
	•	“The pace of societal and corporate change is accelerating, and whether in their personal or professional lives, individuals are forced to make more decisions and make them faster — with less guidance, incomplete information, and few relevant precedents. Successfully navigating such changed and changing landscapes tests one’s self-confidence, good judgement, ability to learn and comfort in making decisions.”
	•	Emotional intelligence
	•	self-awareness
	•	self-regulation
	•	motivation
	•	empathy
	•	social skill

	•	The Spiritual Exercises
	•	Jesuits sometimes refer to themselves as “men of the exercises”
	•	The exercises demand total intellectual, emotional and spiritual engagement. Accordingly, they monopolize focus and energy for their thirty-day duration.
	•	Loyola purged distractions in order to free time and psychic space, so each recruit is left alone with himself
	•	Over the course of a month, trainees deconstruct themselves in order to erect solid personal foundations of self-awareness, ingenuity, heroism and love
	•	The enemy of our human nature, our disordered affections, our false lovers
	•	“taking stock of who I am, where I want to go, and what is holding me back”
	•	Jesuits achieved what we today call ingenuity — a mix of adaptability, daring, speed, and good judgement — only by first cultivating the attitude he called “indifference”
	•	“Inordinate attachments” fog one’s vision
	•	Only by becoming indifferent — free of prejudices and attachments and therefore free to choose any course of action — do recruits become strategically flexible
	•	The indifferent Jesuit liberates himself to choose strategies driven by one motive only: achieving his long term goal of serving God by helping souls
	•	A heroic Jesuit is as much coiled to jump at whats next yet poised to act strategically, both simultaneously at equilibrium
	•	“Love ought to manifest itself more by deeds than by words”
	•	“shared humanity means something”
	•	The exercises were especially designed for those immersed in a busy lifestyle in an ever-changing world… examens work for busy people

	•	The Whole World Becomes Our House
	•	Ingenuity is the readiness to cross the world at a moment’s notice in full-hearted pursuit of a good opportunity, as Xavier was about to do. It is the willingness to work without a script and to dream up imaginative new approaches to problems that have stymied others.
	•	Indifference frees Jesuits from prejudices, attachments, fears, and narrow-mindedness that can block the enthusiastic pursuit of new ideas and opportunities
	•	Instead of running to embrace the world, the pioneers of religious life had mostly headed fast in the other direction, each sheltered like-minded souls who left behind worldly pursuits for monastic study, prayer, and manual labor
	•	Benedictine monks vow “stability” to live their remaining years in the monastic house of which they joined
	•	The Jesuits vowed to find God in the world rather than behind walls
	•	“contemplative in action” wield strategies for maintaining focus and composure in a busy lifestlye
	•	When in Asia, De Nobili had rich arguments in ammuntion from sources spanning everything from Roman mythology to Jesus Christ to St. Augustine to the Hindu laws of Manu. His obscure references likely sent leading theologians scurrying to their concordances in befuddlement
	•	“where does one draw the line between interfaith dialogue and aggressive proselytization
	•	proselytize — convert or attempt to convert (someone) from one religion, belief, or opinion to another.
	•	The Jesuits and the exercises prepare men to be free to do whatever the situation calls for — give an order, take an order or chart his own course; casting the spirit of indifference into a whole new light
	•	The Jesuits were decidedly global, with authority radiating from a strong hub to many spokes, lavishly delegating to whoever could make the best informed, fastest decisions in the field.
	•	“The confidence Loyola showed to those to whom he was entrusting some important affair, by giving them complete freedom, and credit, and allowing them authority to act according to the capacity and talent of each one
	•	“Cut your suit according to your cloth; only let us know how you have acted”
	•	Speed, innovation and global focus happen only when lots of delegated authority sits alongside lots of centralized authority…a tightly centralized authority lay beside wide-open self-initiative 
	•	Take an order today, chart a course tomorrow — just as long as we are headed where we need to go
	•	Those who come to the table with a strong understanding of their non-negotiables can pounce instinctively on opportunities that suit their broader objectives
	•	de Nobili took enormous personal risks while doing difficult, often lonely work and few people can detach themselves from fear with that level off effectiveness

	•	Refuse No Talent Nor Any Man of Quality
	•	The cofounders were determined to enshrine love as a cornerstone in their fledgling company
	•	fledgling — a person or organization that is immature, inexperienced, or underdeveloped.
	•	Loving their superiors, their peers, their subordinates, their enemies, an those they served changed not only the way the Jesuits looked at others, but what they saw. Their vision became more acute, their eyes on talent opened to talent and potential
	•	They saw human talent and potential where others didn’t even look for it. Love was the guiding vision that enabled them to do so
	•	“No perceives others accurately without first achieving healthy self-regard”
	•	“To those who were still children in virtue, Ignatius gave milk; but to those who were more advanced, bread with crust; while he treated the perfect more rigorously still, in order to make them run at full speed towards perfection”
	•	Love-driven leaders hunger to see latent potential blossom and to help it happen, they engender trust, provide support and encouragement, uncover potential, and set high standards.
	•	When love-driven leadership takes root on a widespread basis, it energizes performances and creates unique bonds of team unity. 
	•	Jesuits were well-educated, talented, ambitious and opinionated men
	•	Out basic worldview — our vision of humanity — will inevitably affect our day-to-day dealings
	•	Minimal “teamwork” standards pale when compared with the behaviors of unified, love-driven teams. Unlike energy-sapping workplaces riddled with backstabbing and second-guessing, environments of greater love than fear GENERATE energy.
	•	Those who would rather help peers succeed than watch them fail are creating environments of greater love than fear

	•	An Uninterrupted Life of Heroic Deeds
	•	How to move from cynical, going-through-the-motions performance to motivated, even heroic performance
	•	Invite recruits to turn a corporate aspiration into a personal mission
	•	Create a company culture that stresses heroism, modeling the virtue themselves
	•	Give each person the opportunity to enlarge himself by contributing meaningfully to an enterprise greater than his own interests
	•	Personal commitment needs support and constant reinforcement from the top
	•	“The society wants men who are as accomplished as possible in every discipline that helps it in its purpose. Can you become a good logician? Then become one! A good theologian? Then become one!…and do not be satisfied with doing it half-way.”
	•	“You cannot motivate anyone to do a good job unless he has a good job to do”
	•	A restless, countercultural instinct to keep challenging the status quo was built into Jesuit heroism. The built-in energy of the magis pointed always toward some better approach to the problem at hand or some worthier challenge to tackle. The Jesuit’s self-reflective habits denied them the luxury of “just going with the flow,” so that they may “live with one foot raised.”
	•	“We are working to lay the foundations of houses which will last as long as the world endures”
	•	The candidates they sought were spiritually engaged, totally committed, intellectually superior, capable of debating theology in Ladin with the leading Protestant theologians and of explaining the same ideas in the vernacular to peasant children, ready to cross the globe on forty-eight hour’s notice, equally comfortable working in university lecture halls as in plague hospitals, ready to take orders or design their own strategies.
	•	The real leadership comes from the trenches
	•	“Jesuit leaders exhibited the risk tolerance, creativity, and aggressiveness to capitalize on opportunities”
	•	The network was built from the bottom up, not visioned top-down. Insofar as there was an overarching vision, it was a decidedly retail one — “the teachers should be outstanding.” And so so they ended up with the best network of schools in the world, one outstanding teacher at a time.
	•	heroism — percolates bottom up, from magis-driven leaders. Such heroism can’t be bought, bartered, manipulated, or forced. It’s freely passed along by self-motivated individuals enthused about their work.
	•	Successful leaders spend their time creating environments where individuals will choose heroism as a way of working and living 
	•	Risk-taking comes easier to the edgy, nothing-to-lose start-up than to the well-established, everything-to-lose mainstream player
	•	Superbly educated in core disciplines, yet driven through indifference to seize new intellectual current, Jesuits married traditional scholastic disciplines and the best ideas of progressive humanism in their schools
	•	Magis-driven leadership involves bold imagination and the desire to take bold chances.
	•	Jesuits prospered most when they mustered all the heroism and ingenuity they could to continue their high-wire acts. 

	•	Exceptional Daring Was Essential
	•	Success breeds complacency 
	•	Continued focus on what lies ahead and on what more ambitious goals can be achieved, remains the only reliable way to ensure that important parts of the vision and mission remain vital and aren’t overlooked — or discarded altogether.
	•	ostentation — pretentious and vulgar display, especially of wealth and luxury, intended to impress or attract notice
	•	ignominious - deserving or causing public disgrace or shame
	•	Great results emerge one motivated individual at a time. 
	•	Magis-driven leadership inevitably leads to heroism
	•	Instead of waiting for golden opportunities, they find the gold in the opportunities at hand. Heros lift themselves up and make themselves greater by pursuing something greater than their own self-interest.

	•	The Way We Do Things
	•	The link between self-awareness and ingenuity, stability and change epitomizes self-reinforcing principles in action.
	•	An entrenched culture can make implementing new and different strategies very difficult
	•	A strong corporate culture:
	•	has tangible day to day employee behavior
	•	is strategically appropriate 
	•	promotes adaptability and doesn’t block it
	•	Successful cultures tap the motivating power of deeply held beliefs
	•	The critical importance of creating tangible mechanisms aligned to preserve the core and simulate progress
	•	Well-defined anchoring goals and values enable ambitious, even drastic innovation and adaptability
	•	By clearly demarcating the boundaries he wouldn’t cross, de Nobili understood the playing field within which he could experiment with confidence 
	•	Creative constraints breed creativity
	•	Those who don’t know their nonnegotiable goals and values become loose canons — they have plenty of firepower but no clear target
	•	Jesuit recruits first inventoried personal weaknesses and change-blocking “inordinate attachments”
	•	“Knowing themselves as loved transformed the way they looked at others. Because they were anchored by an appreciation of their own dignity, they developed an appreciation of the aspirations, potential and dignity of others.”
	•	Loyola had understood that Jesuit immersed in a complex world would find themselves confronted with difficult choices.
	•	“No one will successfully honor life principles during EVERY moment of a life lived in vigorous pursuit of those principles.”
	•	Loyola wanted recruits to mull a decision over from different angles, including from the sobering perspectives of one’s deathbed.
	•	Men need to realize that their whole lives can be the example of leadership, whether at the end its considered a success or failure
	•	With personal risk comes missteps, but not to take risks is to shrink from leadership and dissipate one’s potential.
	•	Profound personal transformation takes place over a lifetime: from youth to old age, through changes in occupation, changes in relationships, and changes in life circumstances. What gives give life its wholeness and integrity was his lifelong commitment to a set of goals and values.
	•	Whether these life principles are discovered early or late in life, the commitment to measure life choices against them is crucial. By this process, life is transformed from a succession of random episodes to something whole, a life with integrity.
	•	“Jesuits learn best by teaching others”

	•	Conclusion
	•	“We need more principled and more effective leadership at the helms of major corporations, more confident personal leadership at home and in the workplace, and more visionary and inspired leadership form those who coach, teach, mentor and advise us.”
	•	Companies aren’t self-aware, people are
	•	Magis-driven heroism encourages people to aim high and keeps them restlessly pointed toward something more, something greater, Loyola urged his team to “conceive great resolves and thus elicit equally great desires.”
	•	Magis-driven heroes bring energy, imagination, ambition and motivation to their work; the results take care of themselves.
	•	Heroism lies in the nobility of committing to a way of life that focuses on goals that are greater than oneself.
	•	Love lends purpose and passion to ingenuity and heroism
	•	Run at full speed towards perfection
	•	Self-awareness roots and nourishes the other leadership virtues
	•	On Loyala, “It is unbelievable with what ease our Father recollected himself in the midst of a tide of business.”
	•	We’re all leaders, and we’re all leading all the time, often in small, unintended ways.
	•	Replace accidental leadership with purposeful leadership, of self and others
	•	It’s commonly believed that leaders are those in charge: the generals captains, managers, team leaders, and chief executives. But the Jesuit vision spins that notion on its head. If those once considered followers are in fact leaders, what becomes of those we consider leaders? We need to lead leaders by doing what helps others lead.
	•	When subordinates are courageous enough to venture out on a limb for the company, leader-managers are courageous enough to back. them in their risk taking.
	•	Leader Managers:
	•	lead themselves, inspire others by their own example
	•	find and develop inborn leadership
	•	help subordinates locate their inner switches for motivated performance
	•	trust and support those who are “on the ground”
	•	one on one unadulterated sessions are needed
	•	Effective leaders stick to their counter-cultural, inquiring, magis-driven approach, knowing that trouble will likely arise when they stop asking questions and challenging themselves and others. The modern-day leader who maintains a self-reflective instinct, like the Jesuits who did so nearly five centuries ago, avoids the worst leadership tragedy of all: waking up one morning plagued by the distressing question “What have I been doing with my life.”
	•	Self-awareness is the prelude to fulfilled, committed engagement with the world — and to greater, more heroic leadership. Leaders choose the impact they want to make when they mold a personal modo de proceder.
	•	understanding their weaknesses, values, and worldview
	•	confidently innovating and adapting to embrace a changing world
	•	engaging others with a positive, loving attitude
