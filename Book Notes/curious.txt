Curious
by Ian Leslie

	•	Introduction
	•	Knowledge accumulation is like compound interest and saving…it snowballs. Knowledge loves knowledge.
	•	“I have no special talents, I am only passionately curious” — Albert Einstein
	•	“Curiosity is insubordination in its purest form” — Vladimir Nabokov
	•	The more he learned, the more he wanted to learn
	•	Humans possess a fourth drive, pure curiosity
	•	Curiosity is unruly, it doesn’t like rules, it finds most of them are actually provisional
	•	People who defer too much to the authority of their authority of elders’ ideas are less likely to transcend them
	•	the truly curios will be increasing demand
	•	the curious are most likely to make creative connections between different fields, of the kind that lead to new ideas and the ones best suited to working in multidisciplinary teams
	•	our curiosity is highly responsive to the situation or environment we are in
	•	diversive curiosity manifests itself as a restless desire for the new and the next
	•	unfettered curiosity is wonderful, un-channeled curiosity is not
	•	epistemic curiosity is deeper, more disciplined and effortful than diversive curiosity
	•	empathetic curiosity makes you wonder “why they did it”
	•	we associate intellectual curiosity with dusty academics immersed in esoterica or with the lone eccentric tinkering in his study, rather than with innovation, collaboration, or entrepreneuralism
	•	we focus on the goals of learning rather than valuing for itself
	•	edification — instruction for intellectual improvement
	•	“The only reason people do not know much is because they do not care much. They are incurious. Incuriosity is the oddest and most foolish failing there is.”
	•	We are part biological organism, part cultural; we need both sunlight and knowledge to thrive
