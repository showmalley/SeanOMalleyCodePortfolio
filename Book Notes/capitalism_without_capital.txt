Capitalism Without Capital
by Johnathan Haskel and Stian Westlake

	•	Introduction
	•	For centuries, when people wanted to measure how much something ought to be worth — an estate, a farm, a business, a country — they counted and measured physical stuff. In particular, they measured things with lasting value. 
	•	Investment occupies a central place in much economic thought
	•	Investment is  what builds up capital, which together with labor, constitutes the two measured inputs to production that power the economy.
	•	Intangible assets — typically involve the development of specific products or processes, or are investments in organizational capabilities, creating or strengthening product platforms that position a firm to compete in certain markets.
	•	There are two big differences with intangible assets:
	•	most measurement conventions ignore them
	•	basic economic properties of intangibles make an intangible right economy behave differently than a tangible-rich one
	•	Intangible assets tend to:
	•	be sunk costs — they are harder to sell and more likely to be specific to the company that makes them
	•	generate spillovers — tendency for others to benefit from what was meant to be private investments 
	•	scalable — once an algorithm or a recipe is created, it can be scaled ad infinitum
	•	have synergies — with one another and are more valuable together; and these synergies are often unpredictable
	•	intangible — investment in ideas, in knowledge, in aesthetic content, in software, in brands, in networks and relationships

	•	Capital’s Vanishing Act
	•	investment is very important because it helps build up what they call “capital stock” of the economy: the tools and equipment works use to produce the goods and services that together make up economic output.
	•	asset — an economic resource that is expected to provide a benefit over a period of time
	•	fixed asset — asset that results from using up resources in the process of its production
	•	financial asset — equity stake in a public asset
	•	spending resources — spending cash for operational use
	•	producers — economic value produced by households
	•	factors of production — labor and capital are its two primary sources
	•	the productivity of the manufacturing industry generally increases faster than that of the services industries
	•	cost and willingness to fire people have a positive relationship with intangible investment and less flexible work environments may severely deter intangible investment when it is needed.

	•	How to Measure Intangible Investment
	•	GDP only measures car production and machine output when considering the production of the car industry
	•	quality improvements to to computer capabilities were crucial to understanding US productivity…until you’ve described what you’re gathering, you cannot begin to gather data
	•	3 types of intangible investment:
	•	computerized information (software and data)
	•	innovative property (R&D and creative)
	•	economic competencies (training and market research)
	•	“the purpose of investment is to create a valuable asset”
	•	innovation often involves investing in organizational change, such as creating a new business unit to sell a new product line
	•	with intangible products, some might succeed spectacularly and some might fail miserably, ex post facto
	•	evidence suggests that intangible software assets depreciate at 33% per year, and for design, marketing and training at 15% per year

	•	What is different about intangible investment
	•	Intangibles do not have to obey the same physical laws as tangible assets, they can generally be used again and again
	•	Physical assets are often much easier to sell, even if they are quite specialized, making these costs sunk
	•	Rather unfairly, in intangible investments, the person or business making the investment in them doesn’t always reap the rewards 
	•	Intangibles often have spillovers beyond the company making the investment
	•	Synergies exist between intangibles — synergies that are often large in size and hard to predict
	•	Knowledge is an unusual type of good because putting an idea into practice doesn’t use it up. 
	•	R&D and product development are harder to finance with debt than physical investments
	•	Knowledge cannot exist without information
	•	Embodied intangible asset is like a spaceship, while a disembodied intangible asset is a user interface software
	•	Scalability derives from a key feature of ideas: what economists call “non-rivalry.” 
	•	If I drink a glass of water, you cannot drink that same glass: it is a “rival” good. But if I use an idea, you too can use the same idea: the idea is non-rival. 
	•	Scalability becomes super-charged with network effects, insofar as assets become more valuable the more of them exist
	•	therefore winner take all scenarios are likely to be the norm in intangible marketplaces
	•	There are far fewer standards among intangible assets, nor are most intangibles mass-produced
	•	Standardization of algorithmic functionality to improve re-sale value
	•	Investments with high irrecoverable costs can be difficult to finance, especially with debt. One of the reasons banks love mortgage lending is that their loans are secured on a valuable, immobile asset that can, if the borrower defaults, be seized and sold.
	•	Sunkenness also contributes to the uncertainty around intangible assets. Part of the reason for sunkenness is that intangible assets are often very context specific.
	•	An investment in knowledge, even if it fails to create a marketable asset directly might still be very valuable if if creates information that resolves uncertainty for the firm.
	•	A failure of project A might not directly create a marketable asset , but may very well contribute to what not to do for the success of project B.
	•	Spillovers matter for 3 reasons:
	•	In a world where companies can’t be sure they will obtain the benefits of their investments, we would expect them to invest less.
	•	There is a premium on the ability to manage spillovers: companies that can make the most of their investments in intangibles, or that are especially good at exploiting the spillovers from others’ investments will do particularly well.
	•	Spillovers affect the geography of modern economics
	•	Gradual accumulation of ideas and innovations
	•	technological innovation was “combinatorial,” insofar as any given technology depends on the brining together of already existing ideas
	•	Matt Ridley stresses the evolutionary nature of ideas, “exchange is to cultural evolution as sex is to biological evolution…innovation is when ideas have sex.”
	•	Idas are not expended when they are combined, makes the potential synergies much higher
	•	The moral aspect of open innovation derives from the synergies of intangible investment — which can make sharing ideas mutually beneficial
	•	“No matter who you are the smartest people work for someone else”
	•	Intangible investment
	•	has a tendency to be more uncertain
	•	tend to be worth less if they go wrong
	•	upside is potentially much higher
	•	likely to benefit from scale
	•	tend to be contested, a fight over the spillovers
	•	In an intangible rich economy, we would expect firms to exhibit more uncertainty 
	•	When particular combinations of intangibles are unusually valuable, the power of people who are sufficiently networked or knowledgeable to broker these connections increase

	•	Intangibles, Investment, Productivity and Secular Stagnation
	•	secular stagnation — when business investment is stubbornly low despite every indication that it shouldn’t be
	•	There has always been a gap, some firms have always done better than others, but that gap seems to have widened considerably
	•	multi-factor productivity growth helps us understand where growth is coming from, while single-factor productivity tends to be real output per worker
	•	In several developed countries intangible investments now dominate, and that these intangible investments are poorly measured in national accounts, showing why investment seems low, because we are not measuring all the investment being made
	•	Intangible heavy companies can achieve giant scale with relatively little employment, so productivity per employee rises, perhaps massively.
	•	Spillovers may discourage the average firm from investing in intangibles, but of course, not all firms are average
	•	The “best” firms:
	•	own valuable scalable intangibles
	•	are good at exacting the spillovers from other businesses — being highly productive and profitable and their competitors losing out
	•	Researchers found strong correlation, controlling for a range of other factors, between the stock market value of a firm and its R&D spending and its well-cited patents
	•	Leading firms, which are confident of their ability to create scalable assets and to appropriate most of their benefits, will continue to invest; but laggard firms, expecting low private returns form their investments, will not
	•	Rent-seeking or zero-sum investments are more common among intangible investments than among intangibles 
	•	The legal and institutional structures behind a transformation to an intangible intensive economy are being worked out and that until they are, there will be a disproportionate incentive for firms to spend more on rent-seeking relating to intangible investment.

	•	Intangibles and the Rise of Inequality
	•	increasingly intangible intensive firms will need better staff to create synergy with their other intangible assets
	•	firms will screen them more throughly and pay them more handsomely
	•	Wealth inequality is much higher than income inequality
	•	Pensioners, particularly in wealth terms, are some of the richest people in the country, while the ranks of the poor are dominated by low-paid workers
	•	Computers may start replacing humans much faster than we are used to, and they are not replacing high paid knowledge workers, nor low paid, but routine task middle-income workers.
	•	If returns on capital exceed the growth of the economy as a whole then the slice of the economic pie owned by the rich will generally grow
	•	More technology does not necessarily equal fewer jobs or lower wages
	•	In a world where intangible investment is very important, we would expect to see the best firms, firms that own valuable, scalable intangibles and that are good at exacting the spillovers from other businesses, being highly productive and profitable, and their competitors losing out.
	•	superstars
	•	people who are personally associated with very valuable intangibles that scale massively
	•	have privileged access to very valuable scalable intangibles that reap vast rewards
	•	sorting — people joining high-paying companies tended to be highly paid already
	•	Intangibles are highly contested. The right to use them and the ability to make the most synergies between them are often up for grabs in a way physical assets aren’t…making particular kinds of employees especially valuable to a firm that wants to make the most of its valuable intangibles
	•	Symbolic analysts are educated, smart people with a combination of non-cognitive skills and cognitive skills. 
	•	Companies are particularly eager to hire people who combine decent data analytical skills with the soft skills needed to broker relationships inside and outside their own company
	•	People who are already doing well and, in a world of increasingly important, scalable intangibles, are likely to do even better
	•	The modern economy makes it easier to manage more people, “coordination cost of hierarchical production is constantly decreasing.”
	•	Design new ways of working, developing hierarchies within firms and putting in place software and systems to manage them
	•	fundamental attribution error — the mistaken assumption that outcomes are related to salient inputs rather than dumb-luck or complex, hard-to-observe factors
	•	intangible capital tends to be geographically mobile, making it harder to redistribute wealth via taxation

	•	Infrastructure fo Intangibles, and Intangible Infrastructure
	•	intangible infrastructure — the standards, rules, and norms that underpin businesses’ intangible investment
	•	‘infra’ means ‘below,’ and infrastructure consists of those structures that underpin the way a society works
	•	better information technology might replace some face-to-face meetings, but they might create the need for meetings — and, therefore, increase the value of living in cities where it is easier to meet people
	•	Build or nurture dynamic clusters — places where innovation businesses and people are more likely to come together and share ideas
	•	Since the days of London’s coffeehouses in the seventeenth century, places where people meet and socialize seem to have been important to the coming together of new ideas
	•	Neutral spaces, perhaps especially ones with artistic or creative leaning, create opportunities for combinatorial innovation
	•	Trust among people and firms is an important precondition for intangible investment…and uncertain rules are bad for investment

	•	Challenge of Financing an Intangible Economy
	•	financial markets are short-termist, poorly understand risk, and place perverse incentives on managers
	•	the financial system does a bad job of serving the needs of the real economy, in particular, of providing businesses with the financing they require to invest
	•	it is not always clear that managers who cut R&D spending are doing the wrong thing
	•	the gradual shift to intangibles helps explain many of the perceived problems that the financial sector is accused of
	•	financial markets do a bad job of providing business financing because they are myopic and foolish…and this malign influence is getting stronger as more more aspects of business are “financial-ized”
	•	Industries with mostly tangible assets have high leverage — that is to say, they are funded more by debt than equity — while intangible-intensive industries have less debt and more equity
	•	Equity is a better way of funding businesses with few tangible assets
	•	for many small business owners, there seems a cognitive and cultural bias against giving away equity
	•	The core critique of equity markets: that they reward short-term financial results over long-term investment
	•	The unusual characteristics of intangibles accentuate certain problems of underinvestment, but also create new problems that require different solutions
	•	businesses cut R&D spending when stock markets turn against them
	•	the pressures of financial markets discouraged modern companies from investing in training and employee retention
	•	managers are unusually likely to cut R&D spending in a quarter when they have a lot of equity vesting
	•	companies with more concentrated, sophisticated investors are less likely to feel pressure to cut intangible investment than those with dispersed, unsophisticated ones
	•	VC firms take equity stakes, not debt, because intangible-rich businesses are unlikely to be worth much if they fail—all those sunk investments

	•	Competing, Managing and Investing in the Intangible Economy
	•	commercial success is build on exploiting network effects and economies of scale
	•	in the intangible rich economy, the pressure to compete pushes companies toward large scale and an emphasis on managment
	•	strategic resources are:
	•	valuable
	•	rare
	•	hard to imitate
	•	Perhaps the most distinctive asset will be the ability to weave all thee assets together
	•	Commercial success is built upon
	•	building a proprietary technology
	•	exploiting network effects
	•	benefiting from economies of scale
	•	branding
	•	Adam Smith in The Theory of Moral Sentiments says, “We frequently see the respect attentions of the more strongly directed towards the rich and the great than towards the wise and the virtuous.”
	•	Who decides in a non-centrally planned economy…nobody.
	•	costs are avoided inside the firm via authority
	•	As employment gets increasingly knowledge-intensive, the importance of key knowledge workers to the firm rises if their knowledge is tacit…meaning that intangible intensive firms will be a premium on managers who can share information both up and down the organization and keep loyal workers sticking to the firm
	•	influence activities — time spent away from productive activity
	•	A good organization is about commitment. The organization benefits if it commits not to punish good performance now with over-stretching targets in the future. One way to do this is not gear high reward on day-to-day performance, but instead  promise a steady trajectory of reward over the longer term.
	•	Innovation needs to change from “research” and “development” to “thinking,” “playing,” and “doing.” Stressing the new scope for easier exchange of ideas, experimentation, and faster implementation of ideas.
	•	System innovation relies on leadership, the ability to convince other organizations, networks of partners, and even competitors to do what system innovators wants.
	•	How do leaders get followers to follow them?
	•	align interests between the organization and followers
	•	the leader will have to know more than the followers, and convince the followers of that
	•	followers will be more convinced if they see commitment by leaders
	•	leaders make sacrifices for their followers
	•	additional information helps predict share prices…de-obfuscate some of the intangible forces that be

	•	Public Policy in an Intangible Economy
	•	Slow, gradual change, on the other hand, is something that politicians find very hard to respond to.
	•	When it comes to encouraging investment, stability may be more important than the precise norm that is adopted
	•	In the longer term, the government should create the conditions for a shift from debt to equity financing 
	•	Tax breaks to encourage intangible investment follow a curve that once tax breaks for venture capital get beyond a certain point, they tend to encourage dumb investment
	•	Each year, the underinvestment problem will get worse and worse
	•	It is hard to escape the conclusion that intangible investment is harder for businesses to fund,  and if it is becoming more important to the economy, then unless we are prepared to see a shortfall in investment, the role of the government as an investor will have to grow. Often leaving the government as investor of last resort.
	•	The government of Singapore subsidizes business investment in a range of intangibles through what is in effect an intangibles tax break, the Productivity and Innovation Tax Credit, which covers design, automation of process, training, and the acquisition and development of various sorts of intellectual property, alongside R&D.
	•	Using procurement to encourage innovation involves a risk of failure. If a government cannot tolerate this and constantly tries to mitigate the risk of failure, innovation is unlikely to result.
	•	Education:
	•	adult education does not need to delay people from entering the workforce
	•	being able to invest in a person’s education throughout a person’s life makes many more decades available
	•	availability of adult education reduces the problem of trying to guess what skills will be valuable in twenty or thirty years time
	•	Creating more opportunities for school children to be exposed to technology may increase the pool of people who can share ideas, thus increasing the possibility of positive synergies between tangible in a country.
